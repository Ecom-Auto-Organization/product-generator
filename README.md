# product-generator

This project is used by Ecompal and contains source code for generating products to be created on shopify from excel and csv files.

The application uses several AWS resources, including Lambda functions and an API Gateway API, and SNS. These resources are defined in the `template.yaml` file in this project. You can update the template to add AWS resources through the same deployment process that updates your application code.
